	The miss rate for an array of int64_t with 4 rows by 120 columns would have a miss rate of 12.5%, 1 in every 8. The misses will all be compulsory in that they occur when a new array index that is not part of the cache is being read. This is because the array will be read from row major order. All that is really important is that values that are on the same row never belong in the same set. This is beacuse 120 is 8 less than 128 which is divisible by 32 (the number of sets). This means that each array indice on the same row will belong to succesive sets. All this means that after reading [0][0] we get [0][1] to [0][7] for "free". then the next read [1][0] we get [1][1] tp [1][7] for "free" and so forth. by the time we finish with the first row the next 7 rows are already in cache and we dont have cache misses. Row 8 will be all cache misses again but we once again get 4*7 free accesses. This means that in the end we have a 1/8 or 12.5% miss rate.
