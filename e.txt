	Four was set associative with 32 cache blocks means that we have 4 cache lines for each of our 8 sets. We are transversing the array in row major order. we ahve 128 cols which is divisble by 8. This means that elements that are in the same row will belong in the same set. So we start indexing from [0][0] here we get [0][1] to [0][7] for "free". Then we do the same for [1][0] and so on. The for cache lines from the first 4 reads will all be in the same set but that set takes 4 lines so we are fine. The next 7 row then are given with no misses. Then we move on the the next row. These will all belong in the same set also the next one from the last. we then have a 1/8 miss rate since the patter just repeats.
