d)
	this one has 100% miss rate and the concept is simple. We have 2 way set associativity so with 32 cache blocks that means we have 16 sets. 128 is divisible by 16 so that means that elements in the same row will have to belong to the same set. We are impleneting replacement of least used so when we use sum B and add in row major order [0][0] is done with a compulsory miss then same for [1][0] then same for [2][0], BUT we have to delete [0][0] and the 7 other elements that come along b/c our set only has room for 2 lines. This sadly means that by the time we get to [0][1] we have a miss once again. Since our set only has the lines for [3][0] and [4][0]. B/C of this we miss every time.
